# Code for "NEURAL NETWORKS CAN DETECT
MODEL-FREE STATIC ARBITRAGE STRATEGIES"

# Abstract

In this paper we demonstrate both theoretically as well as numerically that neural
networks can detect model-free static arbitrage opportunities whenever the market admits some.
Due to the use of neural networks, our method can be applied to nancial markets with a high
number of traded securities and ensures almost immediate execution of the corresponding trading
strategies. To demonstrate its tractability, e
ectiveness, and robustness we provide examples using
real nancial data. From a technical point of view, we prove that a single neural network can
approximately solve a class of convex semi-innite programs, which is the key result in order to
derive our theoretical results that neural networks can detect model-free static arbitrage strategies
whenever the nancial market admits such opportunities.
